#########################################################################


Phantasy Phootball is a game that allows a league of friends to make Phish set
list predictions in a fantasy football-like atmosphere. Users will be able to
select a number of predictions such as set 1 opener, set 2 closer, and others
using a simple interface. The app will query the Phish.net API after a show has
been performed, and award points to each user based on how good their predictions
were.

1. As a nerdy Phishhead, I would like to be able to submit predictions for the
songs Phish will play in the following setlist spots before every show:

* Set 1 opener
* Set 1 closer
* Set 2 opener
* Set 2 closer
* Encore
* Cover song (a song by another band that is not a Phish solo band)
* Elemental song (relating to an earth element, like fire, light etc.)
* Gamehendge song (a song the references the band's fictional universe,
Gamehendge (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamehendge))
* Five wild card songs that could appear anywhere
* A song about an animal
* A song with a name as a title
* A song about a place

2. As a poor Phishhead who doesn't have any money to go on tour, I'd like to be
able to automatically have the app check my predictions based on the most
current show.

3. As a nerdy Phishead, I would like to be able to check how long it has been
since Phish played my favorite song.


4. As a bored Phishhead waiting for Phish to go back on tour, I'd like to check
my predictions against a random show.
